# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Changeset Tracking (MANDATORY)

Every code change **must** be accompanied by updates to two files in the `.changeset/` directory (git-ignored, never committed):

1. **`.changeset/PR_SUMMARY.md`** — A detailed, always-current summary of all changes in the working branch. Update this after every modification. Include:
   - What changed and why
   - Files added/modified/deleted
   - Testing evidence or instructions
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes

2. **`.changeset/COMMIT_MESSAGE.md`** — A ready-to-use commit message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Update this after every modification. Format:
   ```
   <type>(<scope>): <subject>          ← max 72 chars total

   - bullet point details of changes   ← wrap at 72 chars
   - one bullet per logical change
   ```
   Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`.

**Workflow**: Create `.changeset/` dir on first change if it doesn't exist. Update both files after every file edit, creation, or deletion — before moving to the next task.
